# Proffy - Next Level Week

Project provided by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br/week/inscricao/11.0) to learn backend, frontend and mobile development employing React JS, React Native and Express.

## :runner: How to run

Open your terminal in the folder you want to clone the project

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LorranSutter/Proffy.git

# Go to the project
cd Ecoleta

# Go to each folder and install dependencies
cd backend
yarn

cd ../frontend
yarn

cd ../mobile
yarn
```

<!-- Now you will need two opened terminals to run the project. One for the backend and another one for the frontend or mobile. -->
Now you will need two opened terminals to run the project. One for the backend and another one for the frontend.

Backend will run on http://localhost:5000/

Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000/

<!-- Mobile will run on http://localhost:19002/ -->

```sh
# Go to backend
cd backend

# Run the project
yarn start

## In the another terminal ##

# Go to frontend
cd frontend

# Run the project
yarn start
```

<!-- For the mobile web app keep backend running and do the following:

```sh
# Go to mobile
cd mobile

# Run the project
expo start
```

This will start expo CLI on your browser. A QR code will appear on your screen and in terminal. You can scan this QR code with [Expo app](https://expo.io/tools#client) to see the application running in your phone. -->
